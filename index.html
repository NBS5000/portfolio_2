        <p class="aboutP" id="aboutTop">Having spent over a decade working in the technical areas of insurance, such as fraud investigation, 
            litigation, complaints, and other fun parts of it, an opportunity arose for me to switch to something 
            I had long held a passion and interest for.....coding.</p>
        <p class="aboutP">Whilst living in Brasil, I studied web development through TAFE distance learning. Upon returning to Australia, 
            I completed further courses, culminating in two TAFE diplomas, Software Development, and Web Development.</p>
        <p class="aboutP">Once my courses were complete, I entered the development community, where I spent time volunteering with the 
            Black Dog Institute, rebuilding and delivering their intranet. After this, I spent a number of years working 
            with the FileMaker platform. Despite becoming an accomplished developer with this, I decided to leave and re-hone 
            my skills with the University of Sydney Full Stack Bootcamp.</p>
